#Chances are, you have to open up your calendar app, select a start and end time, write an event title, click save, then close the app again 😮‍💨 Calendar management can really add up - imagine doing this multiple times a day, especially if you're constantly booking meetings or adding events!
an AI workflow can solve this problem.

in this project, you can add an event just by sending a text to your workflow, which is going to be your AI calendar assistant.
